I also realized the power of paying just a few more dollars in debt per month, and how it accumulates over the years because of interest

Answer to question #2
nfl ended up paying $2938.143 more in debt than fl

Answer to question #3

Answer to question #4
FL has $2049195 more in wealth than NFL after 40 years

Answer to question #5
I think the biggest thing is investing in a high-yields savings account

The power of compound growth should not be underestimated
